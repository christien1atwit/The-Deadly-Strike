# Castagne

Castagne allows you to make fighting games more easily. It is a layer built upon Godot that manages the internal logic needed, so that you can focus on making the game itself.
It focuses on:
- Efficiency: Iterate quickly and frequently. Works online directly. Learn from within the engine.
- Flexibility: Adapt to several genres, and weirder experiments. Can extend easily.
- Tools: Strong tools to help drive development. Make changes safely and in an informed way.
